Welcome to Data Science Methodology 101 From Problem to Approach Business Understanding! Has this ever happened to you? You've been called into a meeting by your boss, who makes you aware of an important task one with a very tight deadline that absolutely has to be met. You both go back and forth to ensure that all aspects of the task have been considered and the meeting ends with both of you confident that things are on track. Later that afternoon, however, after you've spent some time examining the various issues at play, you realize that you need to ask several additional questions in order to truly accomplish the task. Unfortunately, the boss won't be available again until tomorrow morning. Now, with the tight deadline still ringing in your ears, you start feeling a sense of uneasiness. So, what do you do? Do you risk moving forward or do you stop and seek clarification. Data science methodology begins with spending the time to seek clarification, to attain what can be referred to as a business understanding. Having this understanding is placed at the beginning of the methodology because getting clarity around the problem to be solved, allows you to determine which data will be used to answer the core question. Rollins suggests that having a clearly defined question is vital because it ultimately directs the analytic approach that will be needed to address the question.
